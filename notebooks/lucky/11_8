Objectives:

Integrate sensor and pump subsystems.

Perform end-to-end testing.

Record of Activities:

Connected RGB sensor and pumps to Arduino Uno.

Scanned sample colors and verified corresponding paint proportions dispensed.

Conducted full system test for Red (RGB: 200, 50, 50).

Results:

Color Match Accuracy: Î”E = 4.2 (within tolerance).

Debugging Notes:

Issue: Delay in signal processing.

Resolution: Optimized code to reduce processing time to 85 ms.
