Objectives:

Research RGB sensors and select the most suitable model for color detection.

Finalize key components for procurement.

Record of Activities:

Evaluated RGB sensors (Adafruit AS7262 and TCS34725).

Selected TCS34725 due to high accuracy, built-in IR filter, and white LED.

Discussed with team members about the initial wiring setup.

Ordered TCS34725 RGB sensor and Arduino Uno for integration testing.

Design Notes:

Ensured compatibility between RGB sensor and Arduino Uno (I2C communication).

Decision made to use peristaltic pumps for paint dispensing based on fluid handling capabilities.
