Objectives:

Begin integrating the RGB sensor with Arduino Uno.

Test sensor accuracy under different lighting conditions.

Record of Activities:

Connected TCS34725 RGB sensor to Arduino Uno using I2C interface.

Tested sensor with various color samples and recorded RGB values.

Observed ambient lighting causing inaccuracies (~±10%).

Shielded the sensor to minimize light interference, improving accuracy to within ±5%.

Data/Results:

Example readings:

Red: Measured (200, 50, 50), Detected (198, 52, 49).

Green: Measured (50, 200, 50), Detected (49, 198, 51).

Debugging Notes:

Issue: High variance in readings due to ambient light.

Resolution: Added physical shielding to the sensor.
