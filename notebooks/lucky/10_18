Objectives:

Begin integrating the RGB sensor with Arduino Uno.

Test sensor accuracy under different lighting conditions.

Record of Activities:

Connected RGB sensor to Arduino Uno using I2C interface.

Tested sensor with various color samples and recorded RGB values.

Observed ambient lighting causing inaccuracies (~±10%).

Shielded the sensor to minimize light interference, improving accuracy to within ±5%.

Data/Results:

Red: Measured (200, 50, 50), Detected (198, 52, 49).

Green: Measured (50, 200, 50), Detected (49, 198, 51).

RGB Color Sensor Accuracy Color Measured RGB (Reference) Detected RGB (Sensor) Within ±5%? Red (200, 50, 50) (198, 52, 49) Yes Green (50, 200, 50) (49, 198, 51) Yes Blue (50, 50, 200) (51, 52, 198) Yes Yellow (200, 200, 50) (198, 199, 49) Yes Cyan (50, 200, 200) (52, 198, 199) Yes

Debugging Notes:

Issue: High variance in readings due to ambient light.
