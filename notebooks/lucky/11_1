Objectives:

Begin calibration of peristaltic pumps.

Test dispensing accuracy for fluid acrylics.

Record of Activities:

Set up peristaltic pumps with motor driver circuits.

Measured paint volumes dispensed over fixed durations.

Noted inconsistencies at low PWM duty cycles.

Data/Results:

Flow rate: 10 mL/sec at 100% PWM.

Dispensing error: Â±2.5 mL for 100 mL batches.

Design Adjustments:

Adjusted motor control algorithm to account for non-linearity.

Decided to switch to fluid acrylics to mitigate viscosity issues.
