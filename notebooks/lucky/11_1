Objectives:

Begin calibration of peristaltic pumps.

Test dispensing accuracy for fluid acrylics.

Record of Activities:

Set up peristaltic pumps with motor driver circuits.

Measured paint volumes dispensed over fixed durations.

Noted inconsistencies at low PWM duty cycles.

Data/Results:

Flow rate: 10 mL/sec at 100% PWM.

Dispensing error: Â±2.5 mL for 100 mL batches. Peristaltic Pump Accuracy Trial Target Volume (mL) Measured Volume (mL) Within Requirement? 1 50 49.2 Yes 2 50 50.1 Yes 3 50 48.8 Yes 4 50 49.7 Yes 5 50 47.3 No

Design Adjustments:

Adjusted motor control algorithm to account for non-linearity.

Decided to switch to fluid acrylics to mitigate viscosity issues.
